# Little Shop - Coupon Codes | Final Project | Frontend Starter Repo

## Notes

### Abstract:
I did not build the frontend at all. I just reused and added to some code. I built the backend API that this frontend utilizes.

### Installation Instructions:

**Note:** Do **not** clone this repo into your backend repo. Put it somewhere else as a stand alone. The BE and FE repos will remain two separate repos and you will submit the links to each.  

1. Fork repo
1. Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>`

### Context:
Not long enough, not quite a week. I did not do much on this frontend as I ran out of time. I did the very minimum, I added to the getMerchantCoupons function and to the displayMerchantCoupons to get the coupons and display them. I added the .coupon to the CSS that was already written for the merchant and item cards.

### Learning Goals:
Learn how to build a backend API and marry that to a frontend site.

### Wins + Challenges:
I had so many computer technical problems I am just glad I finished it even if it is not the best.
